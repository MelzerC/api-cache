# api-cache

nodejs module to cache an api on local files.

## Usage

In case you installed it globally, just run `api-cache <command> <config> <options>`
To display a help, run api-cache without any options (`api-cache`), this will display a
list of available commands with a short description.

If you do not wish to install this module globally, you may also execute it as a normal
javscript file. Therefor, switch to the working directory of your project and execute
`./node_modules/api-cache/api-cache-cli.js`. This command does not differ from the one
mentioned above.
